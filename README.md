# ZF2 Tool
#
In the last version of zf2 we have modules, and this modules are plugable. 

This tool is about create new project from bash, and add new modules, and maybe scaffolding. 


## You can

### Create a project

'''
php zf2.php create project projectName
'''

### Add new module. 

Inside the project 

'''
php zf2.php create module moduleName
'''

We can just creeate a folder bootstrap inside de application, but you need to configure the module
